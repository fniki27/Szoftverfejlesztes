# Four Colors Game

This game can be played by two players on a 4x4 board. Both players have 6 disks: one has 3 red and 3 blue ones, the other has 3 green and 3 yellow ones. The players take turns placing one disk on an empty square of the board, but a disk **can't be placed** on a square where it has neighbours of the same color (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). The winner is the player whose disk placement results in **4 different colors** vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If neither of them succeeds in doing this, the game results in a draw.
